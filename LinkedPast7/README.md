# Recogito and TextLinker: pathways to semantic annotation in Latin Texts

## What is it?

Here you fill find the materials for the joint [LiLa/Pelagios Working Group](https://lila-erc.eu/linked-pasts-7-woking-group/)
that will meet in the context of the [LinkedPast 7](https://www.ghentcdh.ugent.be/linked-pasts-vii-symposium)
conference.

In particular, during the WG meeting (scheduled for Dec 20, 2021, 15:00 â€“ 17:00 CET.)
we will demonstrate how to annotate texts using Recogito and the LiLa's textlinker
(still in beta).

## Which text will we annotate?

We selected a passage from Pliny, Natural History: book 3, 123-126. The text
was taken from [The Latin Library](https://www.thelatinlibrary.com/pliny.nh3.html).

You can read an English translation of the passage in Perseus([here](https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0137%3Abook%3D3%3Achapter%3D21#note-link9)).

## What else will end up here?

* Pelagios and LiLa annotations
* minutes from the meeting
* links to contacts/feedback forms/other tools to engage our audience even more!
